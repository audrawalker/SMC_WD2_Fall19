            <h1>Empowering YOU to save more pets’ lives with game-changing technology</h1>
            <h2>JULIE CASTLE | SEPTEMBER 20TH 2019</h2>
            <p>Last Saturday, our nation celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969. When President John F. Kennedy challenged the country to realize that momentous achievement with his famous “moon shot” speech in 1962, he said we would need “a giant rocket … made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented….” <br><br>

                    At the Best Friends National Conference in 2016, I stood on stage at the closing session and announced our own moon shot, to take the country to no-kill by 2025.<br><br>
                    
                    Today, I announced the first new “alloy” that we’ve invented to accomplish that goal.<br><br>
                    
                    
                    But first, we need to put the issue into context. Since the animal sheltering industry began 150 years ago, no one has known how many shelters exist in this country, nor did anyone know how many animals were dying. No one had a complete picture of the data.<br><br>
                    
                    Everyone was just guessing.<br><br>
                    
                    For decades, Best Friends Animal Society and like-minded organizations have had to work in the dark to end the killing in shelters because we lacked timely, accurate information about the scale, scope and nature of the problem we were trying to solve. How many animals were being killed? What types of animals were being killed? Where and why was the killing taking place? We relied on best-guess estimates and broad, untargeted programs that might or might not yield lifesaving results.<br><br>
                    
                    Today, that guesswork is over.</p>
