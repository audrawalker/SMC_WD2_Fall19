            <h1>Accountability is key: Why socially conscious sheltering falls short</h1>
            <h2>JULIE CASTLE | SEPTEMBER 20TH 2019</h2>
            <p>No-kill means that 100% of the animals who can be saved will be saved. Under the no-kill philosophy, animals who are irremediably suffering or too dangerous to be adopted are humanely euthanized, but the shelter strives to find a loving home for every other animal, while still ensuring high standards of care. <br> <br>

                    A community that saves the lives of 90% of the animals who enter its public and private shelters is considered to be no-kill. Today, there are more than 4,000 no-kill communities in the United States â€” more than a third of the shelters in the country, representing a wide range of demographics. Many more communities are rapidly approaching that benchmark. To be clear, a 90% save rate is the no-kill threshold, not the ceiling, and the lifesaving rate for many communities is well above that threshold.<br><br> 
                    
                    Likewise, it is understood that there may be special circumstances in which a community could be successfully implementing no-kill principles and practices but not reach a 90% save rate due to the types of services shelters provide to their community. As part of our community lifesaving dashboard project, Best Friends has created a process by which shelters fitting these special circumstances can still be designated as no-kill.</p>
