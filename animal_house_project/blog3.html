            <h1>Hundreds rally to fight pit bull ban in Maryland, but will it be enough?</h1>
            <h2>ELISE TRAUB | OCTOBER 4TH 2019</h2>
            <p>Chompers is the kind of pup we all hope for when we bring a new family member home: kind, easygoing, good with everyone and everything and, best of all, a total love-bug. He lives with my mother-in-law in a community outside of Denver, Colorado, a transplant from a Texas shelter. Since arriving a few years ago, he’s really taken to the Colorado lifestyle, eschewing his cowboy roots for the “chillness” of mountain life. <br><br>

                    For years, Chompers was the ying to his late brother Dempsey’s yang (truth be told, Dempsey, a boxer-like mutt, was a total doofus and troublemaker). In other words, he’s the perfect dog in every possible way. But Chompers lives a few miles from an imaginary line that for decades has served as a boundary between life and death.<br><br>
                    
            
                    That’s because Chompers appears to be a pit-bull-terrier-type dog. If he lived in Denver, which has a long-standing ban on dogs who look like him, he’d be at risk of being seized and killed. For my mother-in-law, the choice is clear and obvious: She opts to live in a community where Chompers can be the loving and spoiled pet he was destined to be.<br><br>
                    
                    Sadly, that option isn’t always available for people, and it’s a big part of why breed-specific and breed-discriminatory laws need to be repealed. And while we will continue to fight alongside you to repeal the ban in Denver, we’re seeing increasingly hopeful signs in another community about 1,700 miles to the east.</p>
