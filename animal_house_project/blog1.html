        <h1>Hurricane Dorian: Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst</h1>
        <h2>SHARON HAWA | SEPTEMBER 9TH 2019</h2>
        <p>Hurricane Dorian will likely affect many shelter pets and communities in the area. Best Friendsâ€™ emergency response team, led by me and Meghann Burke, emergency response technician, began monitoring the storm early on to track its path. It was important to follow the prediction models closely so we could determine the areas most likely to get the worst of the impact and we would know where to focus our support to partners in those areas.<br> <br>

                Early on, we reached out to emergency management agencies and other partners at the national, state and local levels, to determine the type of support that would be needed to help the response efforts. Our regional programs teams began assessing the communities that would be at high risk so they could coordinate necessary transports to help get animals out of danger.<br> <br>
                
                Our teams participate on daily coordination calls to provide the support necessary to get this all done, and the emergency response team sends out regular Dorian-related weather updates and leads daily coordination calls with an internal disaster management team comprising Best Friends staff from different departments. This constant communication by the emergency response team will continue throughout the duration of the storm and afterward.</p>
