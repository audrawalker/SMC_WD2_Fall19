                <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                <p>2 Moon Junction Animal House Project was founded in June of 2001, as a no-kill animal rescue group. By having a small foster network, we were successful in placing over 300 pets in good homes. However, we realized that 95% of the animals being surrendered were because families could not afford to feed or provide basic veterinary care. In 2004, The Chester County Pet Food Pantry was formed and moved to the heart of Chester County with a mission to keep companions pets at home and out of the shelters and rescues. In 2013, with the ever growing need of families and pets, the Pantry moved to a much larger facility in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and began a mobile pet food pantry in Downingtown</p>
